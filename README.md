# appengineFlex
Appengine flex works in local, deploys but `fails` on appEngine flex.

This is test setup to have the `Spring Boot Application` that connects to a remote database hosted on `Cloud SQL (MySQL)` on `flexible appEngine`.

In order to test.

navigate to `domain/user` should yield `1.`

& navigate to `domain/user/1` should spit out `dummy user.`
